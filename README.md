# npxcard
Second node project - got my npx card yet ? 

### Goals : 
-Make a **npx card** pretty straight-forward, *no ?*


#### Run it : 
```
npx ktor_vi
```
##### 2023 - updated 
It was not working, had to downgrade chalk so I could use my special hsl func, check it out it's neat (trigonometry, heh)
